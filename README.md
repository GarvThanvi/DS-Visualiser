Data Structure Visualizing Website
This web application allows users to visualize various data structures including Binary Search, Singly Linked List, and Doubly Linked List. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project aims to provide an interactive way to learn and understand the workings of different data structures. By visualizing operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal, users can gain a deeper understanding of how these data structures function.

Features
Binary Search:

Visualise in detail how the binary search algorithm divides the array in half and finds the key element.

Singly Linked List:

Insert nodes at the beginning, end, and at a specific position
Delete nodes from the beginning, end, and from a specific position

Doubly Linked List:

Insert nodes at the beginning, end, and at a specific position
Delete nodes from the beginning, end, and from a specific position
